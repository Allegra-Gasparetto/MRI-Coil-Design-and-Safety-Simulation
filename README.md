# MRI-hardware

This project presents a complete simulation-based solution to the design and analysis of MRI B₀ and Gz magnetic fields using circular current loops. It also includes a safety evaluation of the resulting fields, covering both translational and rotational forces, as well as Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) risks.

## Notebook
All tasks are completed and documented in a single Jupyter Notebook.
- **`MRIHardware.ipynb`**  
  Contains all simulations, plots, and theoretical explanations across the following parts:
  - Part A: B₀ Coil Construction
  - Part B: B₀ Field Safety Analysis
  - Part C: Gz Coil Construction
  - Part D: Gz Field Safety Analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
